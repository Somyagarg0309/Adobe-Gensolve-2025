# Adobe India Hackathon: Connecting the Dots

Welcome to the repository for solutions developed as part of the Adobe India Hackathon! This project aims to "connect the dots" by building intelligent systems for document analysis, designed to extract and prioritize relevant information based on specific user needs.

## Challenge 1a: PDF Processing Solution

This section outlines the solution for the foundational challenge of processing PDF documents. The core focus here is on robust and efficient handling of PDF content, preparing it for further intelligent analysis.

### Key Aspects:

* **Basic PDF Processing:** Implements essential functionalities for opening, reading, and extracting raw text from PDF files. This forms the bedrock for any document-centric application.
* **Docker Containerization:** The solution is packaged within a **Docker container**, ensuring a consistent, isolated, and easily reproducible environment. This eliminates "it works on my machine" issues and streamlines deployment.
* **Structured Data Extraction:** Focuses on extracting information from PDFs and organizing it into a **structured format**. This often involves parsing text, identifying key elements, and preparing the data for database ingestion or further processing.

## Challenge 1b: Multi-Collection PDF Analysis

Building upon the capabilities established in Challenge 1a, this section details the solution for advanced analysis across multiple PDF collections. The emphasis shifts to deriving deeper, personalized insights from diverse document sets.

### Key Aspects:

* **Advanced Content Analysis:** Beyond simple text extraction, this involves sophisticated techniques to understand the **meaning and context** of the content. This might include semantic understanding, entity recognition, or relationship extraction.
* **Persona-Based Analysis:** A crucial enhancement, this feature tailors information retrieval and analysis based on a **defined user persona**. By understanding who the user is (e.g., "financial analyst," "research scientist") and their "job-to-be-done," the system can prioritize and present information most relevant to their specific role and task.
* **Scalability for Multiple Collections:** Designed to efficiently process and analyze data from not just one, but **multiple PDF collections**, enabling cross-document insights and comparisons.
